# Artificial Intelligence in Antivirus Technology
Undergraduate Thesis - Use of Artificial Intelligence in Antivirus Technology 

This project is aimed at using Artificial Intelligence techniques such as heuristic scanning, prototype based clustering and classification 
in the domain of malware detection.

The proposed solution is an incremental process that prototypes and incrementally detects malware using classifiers.
The incremental process looks for behavioural patterns in the malware.

More details on the approach, design and implementation can be found here :

#Execution instructions

>> 1. Run ClamAV for signature based detection
>> 2. Run checkcfg.py under CFGCreation
>> 3. Using the refset and xml as training data set, run incremental.py
This will internally run Farray.py, Proto.py, Cluster.py and Classify.py in the same order.
